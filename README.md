# Bevy Pan/Orbit Camera

Basic orbit camera controls for Bevy. Supports orbiting, panning, and zooming.

It was designed as a plug and play camera to get up and running quickly, with good defaults. Best suited for quick
prototyping and 3D experimentation.

Default controls:

- Left Mouse - Orbit
- Right Mouse - Pan
- Scroll Wheel - Zoom

## Demo

## Features

- Smooth orbiting motion
- Works with orthographic camera projection in addition to perspective
- Customisable controls and sensitivity
- Works with multiple viewports and/or windows

## Quick Start

Add the plugin:

```rust ignore
.add_plugin(PanOrbitCameraPlugin)
```

Add `PanOrbitCamera` to a camera:

```rust ignore
commands
    .spawn((
        Camera3dBundle::default(),
        PanOrbitCamera::default(),
    ));
```

This will set up a camera with good defaults.

Optionally configure settings:

```rust ignore
commands
    .spawn((
        Camera3dBundle::default(),
        PanOrbitCamera {
            beta: TAU * 0.1,
            radius: 5.0,
        },
    ));
```

Check out the [advanced example](https://github.com/Plonq/bevy_panorbit_camera/tree/master/examples/advanced.rs) to see
all the possible options.

## What are `alpha` and `beta`?

Think of this camera as rotating around a point, and always pointing at that point (the `focus`). The sideways rotation,
i.e. the longitudinal rotation, is `alpha`, and the latitudinal rotation is `beta`. Both are measured in radians.
If `alpha` and `beta` are both `0.0`, then the camera will be pointing directly forwards (-Z direction). Increasing
`alpha` will rotate around the `focus` to the right, and increasing `beta` will move the camera up and over the `focus`.

## Cargo Features

- `bevy_egui`: makes PanOrbitCamera ignore input when interacting with egui widgets/windows
