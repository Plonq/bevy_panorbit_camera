# Touch Example

This example is based on Bevy's `mobile` example, but simplified and using `PanOrbitCameraPlugin` to demonstrate
touch controls.

## How to Run

Change into this directory

```shell
cd examples/touch
```

Build and run in Simulator

```shell
make run
```

(Optional) Specify specific Simulator device ID

```shell
export DEVICE_ID=...
make run
```

You can also open the XCode project and run on a real device from there.
